# web-scrapping ENGI3

In this repository I will present a very simple way of web-scrapping ENGI3 data from fundamentus, a site that provides financial and fundamental information about companies with shares listed on Bovespa, the brazilian market. The purpose of creating this repository would be to provide a script that would scrape the periodicity and value of Engie's shares to help investors in how to diversify their assets in the best way.

## The scraping will have the following variables as final output:

- Data	
- Value
- Type
- Day of payment
- How many shares 


The site used was [Fundamentus](url)
## How to run the project
- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt command
- Run the code and a .csv file will be generated with the scraped data
